<li>In India the occurances start from Jan22 onwards. However the frequency is very low in the start of the year - less than 0.5%. By the 95% CI the values can be atmost around 1.9% in start of 2022. There are no data points observed for the months Feb22,Mar22.</li>

<li>The occurances are recorded starting Jan22 in all the 10 countries.</li>
<li>The trend follows a common pattern in all the countries. High in Jan22 and a drop in Feb22, followed by continuous low frequency. </li>
<li>From the trend I suspect that this variant would have it's first apprarance in the year 2021 which is out of the observation horizon.</li>
<li>I confirm my notion by realising this is the delta variant. </li>
<li>USA,UK has frequency of 60%,65% in Jan22. Spain and Germany has frequency around 80% in Jan22. Canada and South_korea has frequency around 96% in Jan22. While countries Denmark,India,Australia,Norway has frequency less than 25% in Jan22.</li>
<li>Discontinuous occurance: In south Korea and Australia there are long time periods (more than 6 months) with no occurances and then sudden occurances are noted. For example in South_korea Apr22-Oct22 there are no datapoints and from Dec22-May23 there are no occurances. In USA there are 5 continuous months of no occurance. India has 4 months of No data points. These countries have the trend extending from 2022-2023 but it has many months of no occurnaces.</li>
<li>Spain has the longest trend with no long periods of silence. From Jan22-Feb23</li>
